# Politicians-Api

This is an api that allows users to browse information about the politicians of my country, Finland. This is one of the three main repositories that compose my web app. This is the API part. Other parts are Client (React Native) and Bots(rust).

This repo includes the database schema used in my database. It uses PostgresQL database and rusts psql crate for connections
